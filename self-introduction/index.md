## About Me

Hello! My name is Andrey, I am 32 years old. I live in Saint Petersburg. By education, I am a manager, but my passion for computer technology completely changed my career path. For the past two years, I have been working in technical support, and before that, I was involved in procurement.
In the autumn of 2023, I took a JavaScript course on Udemy and came across the RS SHOOL through one of the Telegram channels. Deciding that web development is what I want to pursue, I decided to undergo training at Stage 1 at the RS School. Completing this stage of training, I realized how significantly I expanded my knowledge and skills in this field. Now I have a clear understanding of the direction in which I want to develop, and I am eagerly striving to achieve my goals.

## Projects

Especially i want to highlight the projects I developed at the first stage at RS SHOOL. In these projects, I had the opportunity to practically use various web development tools, such as SCSS preprocessors, Webpack project builder, ESLint and Prettier utilities, as well as work with server-side on the Node.js platform.

## Interests

In my free time, I enjoy reading programming books and participating in online courses to constantly improve my skills. My goal is to become a highly qualified web developer and contribute to the creation of innovative projects in this field.
Snowboarding is also one of my hobbies. Every winter, I try to dedicate time to this sport, enjoying the speed and freedom on the mountain slopes. In the summer, in my free time, I enjoy cycling and spending time outdoors.
